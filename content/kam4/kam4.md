The McLeadership Youth and Mentoring Foundation, Inc. is proud to present its Founder & CEO  scholarship! Kenneth A. McClendon, Founder of the McLeadership Youth and Mentoring Foundation, Inc., has work diligently and tirelessly over the last ten years volunteering to mentor and minster to teenagers at the Fellowship of Faith Church International and throughout the community of Atlanta. He has worked the state foster care system where he was responsible for fiscal payments to over 3000 foster care youth at any given moment. He built relationships with colleges across the United States to ensure that foster care youth throughout the state of Georgia could attend any college they wanted to as long as they met the requirements. Kenneth serves as an advocate for the H&R Block Dollars and Sense financial literacy curriculum in his community. This curriculum teaches youth how to be financially responsible in todaysâ€™ economy. While teaching the H&R Block Dollar and Sense curriculum, Kenneth co-wrote the financial literacy program for the state foster care system. He continues uses his income taxation background to teach local high school students in the Douglas County School System how to prepare simple 1040ez tax returns so they can better use their refunds on paying school dues versus paying a tax preparer.



Along from caring for youth, Kenneth also serves as the chairperson over the Video Ministry at the Fellowship of Faith Church International in East Point, GA. He leads a team of five dedicate volunteer staff members who records, produces and archives church services and special ministries. Kenneth assists with the Friday Night Clean Up, which is a ministry that prepares the worship center for Sunday services and where he attends church. Currently, Kenneth holds the following professional titles: Chief Financial Officer for the NOIR Group, Educator for the Douglas County School System, Sr. Tax Consultant for H&R Block and Founder & CEO of the McLeadership Youth and Mentoring Foundation, Inc.



Kenneth believes in the biblical principle of sowing and reaping. He has given several scholarships to students who have graduated from attended Southwest Atlanta Christian Academy over the past three years. This year, the McLeadership Youth and Mentoring Foundation, Inc. has the honor and privilege of providing two scholarships in honor of our Founder and CEO, Kenneth A. McClendon.



For the year of 2018, two participants will be awarded the KAM4 Scholarship! All applicants are encouraged to apply early. The board of directors will determine the scholarship recipients and award amounts based on anticipated funding. All receipts will be notified via US MAIL regarding the status of their application.
