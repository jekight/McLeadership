Scholarship awards range in nominal amounts up to $1500 and must be used towards college tuition fees, books, and or school supplies for the awarded recipient.

A part of McLeadership’s commitment to the community is our continued accessibility to the scholarship recipients and our mission to “give with a purpose.” Our award recipients are encouraged to stay connected to the foundation as we are supportive with tools, information, and resources that empower students towards fulfilling their educational goals. McLeadership recognizes the importance of building relationships and are excited to be a part of our scholarship recipient’s success story. 

We fundamentally believe in sowing and reaping. This inspires us to sow into the lives of students with an expectancy for our community reaping the benefits of scholars who make a positive impact in the world.
