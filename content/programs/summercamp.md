McLeadership provides a Summer Learning Camp that is better than any summer camp. Our Summer Learning Camp runs from June to July. We offer an environment where learning is fun.  Our Summer Learning Camp includes: summer enrichment studies in Literacy, Reading, Math, Technology and Science. We will also have music, field trips, out door play time, arts and craft sessions, dance/fitness sessions, team building activities, daily story time, and most importantly advance tutoring to include a recap of what our students should know from their previous grade levels and tutoring for what students will be learning in the next grade. Everyday, every child will discover, explore, and learn! This is a Learning Camp like no other. If you are interested in our after school program, then head over to the Contact Page and fill out the contact form. Our team will then reach out to you shortly!
