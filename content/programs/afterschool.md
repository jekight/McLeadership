The McLeadership Youth and Mentoring Foundation acknowledges that quality education during the early years of a child's education is the most critical education that children will receive. 



Our After School Tutoring and Learning Program is one of the best in the State of Georgia!  The McLeadership After School Tutoring and Learning Programs runs from 3:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. We provide pick up services from local schools, computer time, recess time, daily healthy snacks, story time, and one on on assistance with homework!  



We are now accepting applications for the 2016-2017 school year! Please click on the link below for a application.  For more information, please contact Ms. Kelli McClendon, Program Director at 404.538.0519.
