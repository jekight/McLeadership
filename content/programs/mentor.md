McLeadership is proud to offer mentoring services to our community. We noticed there is a strong need for quality mentorship in our community and we are here to serve and help. We are partnering with United Way, Big Brothers Big Sisters of Atlanta and other community based organizations to give back through mentoring.
 
There is no fee involved with mentoring. Although our mentors often incur cost in the process of mentoring, we encourage our mentors to make financial literacy meaningful, purposeful and practical to minimize the cost of their mentor/ mentee relationship.
 
The majority of our mentoring takes place through community service. Some of our community service projects include lawn care for the elderly, widows/widowers, and our veterans.
 
We also mentor through activities such as Pedicure and Manicure sessions, work out sessions, supporting youth birthdays and many more events.
 
If you would like to be involved in any capacity, please feel the contact form and we will be in contact with you soon.
