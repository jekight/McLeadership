At the McLeadership Youth and Mentoring Foundation, we are focused on providing services to at risk and foster care youth; as well as families in our communities with the highest levels of customer satisfaction & we will do everything we can to meet their expectations. With a variety of offerings to choose from, we're sure you'll be happy working with us.


We are a registered 501(c)(3) in the state of Georgia and we are currently serving the entire state of Georgia! 



Established in 2015, our organization was founded on two beliefs. We believe according to Psalms 127:3-4, “Lo, children are the heritage of the Lord: and the fruit of the womb is his reward. As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth” and it takes a village to raise a child.
