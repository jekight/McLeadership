"My children started McLeadership at the conception of the Afterschool program and remained for three years, including summer camps. We had an amazing experience with McLeadership. Ms. Kelli is an experienced teacher with a gift to connect with each child in a special way to bring out their best academically; the children respect her authority. I call her the 'child whisper'. If you are looking for a place you can trust, your child will be well cared for and loved like family. I highly recommend!"
