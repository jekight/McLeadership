As students transition to higher grade levels, they are exposed to increasingly complicated and complex subject material, especially in the area of mathematics. The material builds upon itself with connections that, without the proper attention to detail, will be hidden from the student. When students lose their understanding of how concepts are related, they become discouraged and their ability to progress in math starts to regress. In our experience, this lost understanding often occurs with the introduction of algebra concepts because the difficulty of the material takes a leap forward. In classrooms across the world, you can almost hear students thinking: "since when are there letters in math and when am I ever going to need to solve for 'x'?". If a student does not understand why certain concepts are needed or how the content impacts them directly, the student may dismiss the subject entirely. However, when there is a personal interest in a subject, an individual is more motivated to learn and develop their skills in that area. Lastly, every teacher wants to prevent a disconnect in a student's interest and learning. However, teachers are often required to design strategies that address as many learning styles as possible while maintaining an appropriate pace to expose the students to all the concepts. Unfortunately, even with the best of intentions, students can fall through the cracks. The connections between mathematical concepts begin to be lost and the student's personal interest begins to fade. However, not all hope is lost!
  
Tutoring is a powerful tool for students to close the gap in their understanding of concepts so they can continue to progress in their learning. Here at McLeadership Youth & Mentoring Foundation, we offer specialized tutoring in Foundations of Algebra, Algebra I & II, and College Readiness by none other than our founder, Mr. Kenneth McClendon. The instruction provided by Mr. McClendon is unmatched due to his educational background and his unique ability to bring math concepts to life. Mr. McClendon graduated from Clayton State University with a Bachelors of Business Administration and then obtained a Masters of Business Administration in Public Administration from Strayer University. Throughout his career, he has worked in numerous positions for various companies. However, the one thing that has never changed is his drive to help others. To advance this cause, Mr. McClendon obtained a teaching license, certifying him to teach math from the 6th to the 12th grade level. His experience in the classroom helped him understand the value of differentiated instruction, and he regularly tailors his teaching strategies to individual students. He excels at not only communicating complex concepts in ways that are understandable for learners, but he also helps students realize the broader meaning of answers. Mr. McClendon has a proven track record of getting students to the next level and we are confident that, if you seek his help, you will not be disappointed.
