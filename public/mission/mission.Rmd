The McLeadership Youth and Mentoring Foundation is a nonprofit organization created for helping scholars advance their education, while challenging them to grow in their personal life! We believe that every child has a purpose and we are dedicated to helping children navigate life and discover that purpose.

> Intelligence plus character, that is the goal of true education.  - Martin Luther King Jr
